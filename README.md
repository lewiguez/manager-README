# My Manager README
Hello. 👋 Welcome to my manager README.

## Wut?
This document is a collection of thoughts and notes on how I work that should help you and I get started working together quickly with (hopefully) less pain. I believe it’ll help you figure out how to become more effective at O’Reilly and reduce managerial overhead on my side. This will also give you something to use to hold me accountable. 

Its intention is to give you an idea of how I think and how I work.

## What this isn’t…
* **This isn’t meant to replace our relationship and mutual understanding we’ll build as we work together.** That’s one of my favorite parts of my job.
* **This isn’t meant to be followed too rigidly.** I can’t predict the future nor do I expect you to either.
* **This document applies to me and me only.** It doesn’t apply to anyone else at O’Reilly.

## My assumptions
Before we get started, here are a few assumptions I think we should start with, so we’re on the same page:

* **You’re very good at your job.** You wouldn’t be here if you weren’t. If I’m questioning you it’s because I’m trying to 1) gather context or 2) be a sounding board.
* **I’m not good at your job.** I used to be an engineer (I still dabble 😉) and this can get me into trouble sometimes. I’ll work hard to help you vet your ideas, but I will rarely override you without good cause.
* **You’ll let me know if you can’t do your job.** One of my main responsibilities is ensuring that you’re set up for success. Occasionally things slip through the cracks and I won’t know I’m letting you down. Please tell me if this happens.
* **You feel safe debating with me.**

## My goals
* **Ship great things.** Yeah. This is a big one. Don’t mistake position #1 for it being the most important to me always though. I still value humans over products any day.
* **Attract and retain world-class talent.** Yes, this includes you. If I do something that negatively impacts my ability to retain you, you would be doing me a *HUGE* favor if you let me know about it, as soon as possible.
* **Set context.** If it sounds like I’m just telling you how to do your job, I’m probably not providing you with enough context. Call me out on it. I’m happy to help connect the dots that often get stuck inside my head.
* **Mentor Individual Contributors and future managers.** I’m doing O’Reilly a disservice if I’m not fostering a culture of mentorship on our team. I expect more senior folks to spend some of their time to build up and work with more junior folks. It’s how I’ve been successful. I want others to be successful too.
* **Help you find success and happiness in your work.** I want to help you improve your technical skills, your interpersonal skills (or “soft skills”), grow your career, enjoy your work, and believe in O’Reilly’s mission.
* **Help the team align together and work together.** The old rowboat analogy. We can’t go anywhere if we’re not rowing together in the same direction. If you feel like we’re starting to row in different directions, let me know sooner rather than later. 
* **Take a month off and not have to worry about anything.** No, seriously. If I can do this, I have done my job.

## What to expect from me
I think the most succinct way of putting what to expect from me is that _**I’m an imperfect human being and I expect you to be one too.**_

It’s important to note that I don’t want to become “the official decision maker.” Because of the nature of my personality, I find myself defaulting to that and try hard to course-correct when I realize I’m doing it. Part of that is because I like to have clear, discrete steps and when something gets in my way, I want to remove that hurdle as quickly as possible. A good way to put what I’m striving for instead: “I am **accountable** for the decisions the team makes, even if I’m not the one making them most of the time.”

My past is also marked by a lot of engineering and Individual Contributor work. As such, I tend to fall back hard on old patterns and look at the world through this lens. I have strong opinions about how things should be done because I care deeply about our work. That being said, I will always do my best to respect your opinion too; I will try hard not to take for granted the mutual passion we each have for our jobs and what is produced. I expect you to do the same.

Another important part of my management philosophy: **I’m here to help you be awesome.** That might mean being your cheerleader when you need it. That might mean giving you some critical feedback if I think it’s helpful and warranted. Just know that I’m not the type of person that’s looking to see you fail. I want you to be successful and everything I do is in pursuit of your best interests. 

### Other expectations
* **I like cheering for you.** My job is sometimes a thankless job. I like to support and shout about your success. It’s one of my favorite things. If you don’t want the attention, I’ll abstain. But, you should let me know ahead of time before I shower the Slack channels with your praises.
* **I will forget to cheer for you.** As much as I like to do it, I miss things or don’t know things are important to you. If you want to make sure I say something out loud, mention it to me.
* **I’ll tell you when something is wrong as soon as possible.** I don’t want you to wait months to find out you needed to course correct on an action. I like to give feedback often and as close to the context of the moment as possible.
* **I don’t like unresolved conflict on a team.** Who does? Let’s talk about it when someone steps on your toes and work hard to make sure we all function in a safe, happy environment. If you feel like you’re having problems with someone, let me know ASAP. I’m always trying to pay attention to how people are communicating and working together. Cues are harder to read when we’re remote, but I’ve gotten very good at reading our team. If you don’t tell me about it, I’ll probably ask you about it in our next one-on-one (or sooner).

## What I expect from you
My primary expectation is that you’ll **do amazing work.** If there is something preventing you from doing this, tell me.

Another major thing I expect from everyone (you, our team and everyone inside O’Reilly) is **empathy**. What does that mean?

* Treat people how you would like to be treated.
* Ask questions before assuming. Maybe someone else did something because they simply didn’t know what you’re concerned about was a problem. Dig into the details before forming an opinion
* Start with kindness and respect. We’re all working hard to make something awesome. Let’s be respectful of each other in our interactions.

Work/life balance is important at any job. I’ve been burned out before and it’s not fun or useful. There are certainly times you have to push hard, but those should be the exception and not the rule. *This job enables you to live your life; it shouldn’t be your life.*

### Other expectations
* **_Lots_ of communication.** Most of our team is remote. This is great. But, that also means communication becomes _critical_. I can’t pick up on body language or ask you questions as I pass you in the hallway. That means you and I will both have to make it a priority to communicate. See the section on Communication for the best ways to reach out. Don’t wait for a one-on-one if it’s urgent or pressing.
* **Healthy disagreement with me.** There is always disagreement and debate in any healthy organization. I will have thoughts on your code. You will probably have thoughts on mine. That’s fine! Let’s try to separate our egos from our ideas with the goal of coming to the best possible solution.
* **Code will get shipped…** Code that isn’t shipped doesn’t help our users, it doesn’t help our business, and it probably doesn’t help you. We have a culture of getting things out the door at O’Reilly and I expect everyone to maintain that. I’ll do my best to facilitate it happening.
* **…but not at the expense of your well-being.** Guess what? Seeing you on Slack 24/7, responding to messages late at night, and 3:00am Saturday commits won’t make me excited unless it’s something you are choosing to do. Even then, I’ll probably question it if it happens too much. It’ll probably lead to a discussion about work/life balance and making sure you’re not burning yourself out. A burned-out you doesn’t help our users, it doesn’t help our business, and it definitely doesn’t help you.
* **You’ll tell me when something is wrong.** Problems that are out in the open are a learning opportunity. Problems that are hidden are a failure. If it’s something a little more personal, talk to me. I’m always available for a chat and will move things around on my calendar to accommodate you.
* **You’ll tell me when I screw up.** This is very important. I screw up and sometimes don’t notice. I need to know or I’ll likely do it again.
* **You want to grow.** Your career is yours. You know best how you’d like to grow and in what areas. I can provide feedback and an outside perspective. I’ll do my best to provide growth and learning opportunities, but it’ll be up to you to seize them. Let’s work together on this. At the end of the day, it is your career. You set your goals. You set your priorities. Let me know how I can help you.
* **You’ll be available when you say you’re available.** I expect you to be available when you’ve said you’re available, but I don’t expect immediate responses to Slack questions. If you need to step away for a minute, just post a message in the team channel and let everyone know. You won’t be punished for an occasional mind-clearing break or a quick coffee run. We hire people we trust. If I can’t trust you to use your time wisely, then why would I trust you to build something for our business?
* **Bring your friends.** We’re growing the team and you know who you want to work with.

## Feedback
Feedback is critical to both of our successes. Three dimensions are required for people to continue to give you feedback:

1. **Safety** Unlikelihood of being punished for giving feedback. This should be high.
2. **Effort** The amount of work in order to give feedback. This should be low.
3. **Benefit** How likely is it that giving you feedback will materially impact your behavior? This should be high.

Let me know if I don't do well on any of these three dimensions.

## My schedule
If you need to schedule something with me, it’s best to use my calendar. It’s 99% truth-y, with the exception of some of the daily discussions and impromptu meetings I get called into.

### Availability
I start my day around 8am right now. I generally head out to eat dinner some time after 5pm. I’ll usually mute Slack notifications during my lunch and in the evenings, but I’ll typically check in throughout the evening to make sure things are running smoothly and there are no major questions or issues. I have Slack on my phone and will respond there as needed after-hours.

**I don’t expect you to do this.** You are free to make yourself as available as you please after-hours and on weekends. You are free to not install Slack on your phone. You are free to ignore any message I send on the weekend until the following work day.

**I will make myself available for you.** I will move things around. I will cancel meetings. My schedule isn’t 100% the same every day, every week, and every month. Don’t wait until our one-on-one to tell me about a problem you’re having. I’m here to serve you and I can’t do that effectively unless I know about a problem.

My attention is limited and I’ll do my best to ask questions and stay on top of things, but I will miss things. Over-communicate and tell me about something even you think I might already know. I probably don’t, or I don’t know how important it is to you.

## Communication
I’m pretty easy to get in touch with, but I do have a preference for communication, in the following order:

1. **Slack (in-channel)** — I like for the team to use this tool and solve engineering problems in channels as much as possible for others to see and gain context. I don’t like private messages for solving engineering problems unless they’re more sensitive.
2. **Slack DMs** — Something on your mind? Do you see conflict and want to make sure I’m aware? Got an HR question or heard a rumor you need to talk about? Need something _now_? DM me. I get notifications on my computer and phone and will respond as quick as I can to DMs.
3. **Slack calls** — Got something more complex to talk about? Let’s do a quick Slack call in-channel or in-DM. I prefer ad-hoc to scheduled for most things. My job is interrupt-driven and I’ll do my best to work on your schedule if you’re having a problem.
4. **Google Hangouts** — If your problem can wait or, it requires multiple people, we should probably schedule it. Try to pick a time that works best for you. My calendar is accurate and I can usually move things around. I’ll tell you if I can’t.
5. …
6. **Twitter** — Have things really gone wrong? This should be a last resort, but I’m pretty accessible on Twitter (for now at least). Feel free to find me at `@beardforhire`.

## 1-1s (One-on-ones)
I believe that regular one-on-ones are one of the most important things I do as a manager. This isn’t my meeting. **This is your meeting.**

I’d prefer not to do status update meetings, but I’ll probably default to that if you’re not bringing things to talk about because I’m awkward and don’t want to sit in silence. I’ll occasionally prod and intentionally make things anyway.

I try to take notes and follow up on things after we speak, but I miss things. If you see something I’ve missed, call me out on it. 

I’ll usually start with bi-weekly one-on-ones and ratchet up as necessary. If I’ve missed one, I’ll try to reschedule. I don’t want to go a month without talking to you directly. If I fail to reschedule, put it on my calendar. Don’t hesitate. 

Also, [make it awkward in our 1-1s.](https://medium.com/@mrabkin/the-art-of-the-awkward-1-1-f4e1dcbd1c5c) Please.

## That’s all!
This is (hopefully) all you need to know to work with me. This is a living document and will definitely change at some point. 

For now, here are some things about my personal life we can talk about if you’re interested.

### My life and interests
I have a wife and two kids—one in middle school and one in elementary school. The older one is named Isaac and the younger one is named Jude. You will hear about them occasionally and probably see them at some point “helping me code” (i.e pushing what buttons I tell them to push).

I live in Ohio. I love Ohio. You should move here because it’s awesome. If you ever want to get my attention, start talking about Ohio in a Slack channel. I have my Slack alerts set up for most major cities in Ohio. (Seriously. Try it.)

I care deeply about tacos, pizza, coffee, and hamburgers. I like simple ingredients in my food, composed together to form complex, yet familiar, tastes. I think this also describes how I live my life and what I pursue.

I don’t support two spaces after periods unless I’m writing a term paper. And, I’m probably not writing a term paper.

### My developer story

I’ve had a computer since second grade and haven’t been able to separate myself from one since. My first computer was a 386sx my parents bought from Sears that ran a now-obscure, DOS-based operating system called GeoWorks. I remember tinkering around with QBasic files to change things in my games. I installed a hex editor at some point (looking back I still don’t how I found one or had one on a floppy) and flipped random bits in executables to see if I could make things change.

My high school self bought a book called  [Create Your First Web Page In a Weekend](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0761524827/creatyourfirstwe)  and I’ve been developing for web (and later mobile) ever since.

### Technology
I started out on HTML/CSS and graduated to PHP and C#. I traded in MySQL at some point for Postgres, SQLite, and Oracle (plus MongoDB for a spell… I don’t really talk about that anymore 😉). 

As far as mobile goes, I started out on iOS, but I’ve done some Android work too. I’m not fluent in Android anymore, but I’m proficient and able to help out with code reviews with some context provided on the code. 

### Miscellany
Here are a few mildly interesting facts about me and my life:
* My favorite classic board game is *Scrabble.*
* My favorite board game in general is *Splendor.*
* I like to roast my own coffee beans.
* I love tacos. (Who doesn’t?)
* I also like a good plate of nachos.
* I like to run in races. The longest I’ve ran is a half-marathon and I don’t really have a desire to run a full marathon. Feel free to point this bullet point out to me when I eventually succumb to the peer pressure of my running friends and dive in.
* Objective-C and Swift are my favorite languages I’ve worked in. Although, there are some contenders to dethrone as of late.
* This is the last bullet point.

And, this is the last sentence.

Except this one.
